### Data Scraping

This project is inspired by Coursera capstone project for the course "Applied Data Science Capstone" offered by IBM.

Project shows the distribution of postal areas on a map using:

    1. Data scraped from Wikipedia
    2. Geopy to get location (latitude, longitude) of a postal
    3. Folium to plot each address or postal on map.
    

### Prerequisite

You only need a jupyter-notebook environment to run the codes.


### Getting Started

You can clone the project using git or simply download the notebook.
